            <p class = "left">Meat is actually pretty simple: amino acids, fats, carbohydrates,<br/>
trace minerals and water combined to give us that familiar chew, <br/>
resistance, and variation. But what if we are able to take these <br/>
same inputs from plants and combine them to look and feel just <br/>
like animal meat? What you’d have is meat for the future. <br/>
Meat from plants. </p>
